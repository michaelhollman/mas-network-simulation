This contains a C# app that takes as input the `csv` text sinks generated by Repast batch runs. Each batch run generates about 2.2 GB of raw data and this parser aggregates it down to between 1 and 2 MB of data that we then use for graphing and visuals.

Please note that the code included in this tool was created as an ad-hoc tool and is not set up to be conveniently run elsewhere. The code is only included for completeness.
