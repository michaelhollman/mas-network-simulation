# MAS NetworkSimulation
A multi-agent peer to peer network simulation using Repast<br/>
CSCE475H, Spring 2015 | Dr. LeenKiat Soh

### Getting Started

Our simulation was built against Repast Simphony 2.2, and developed in Java using Eclipse.  To run the simulation:
- Ensure that Repast Simphony 2.2 is installed on your system
- Open Eclipse, and ensure that the Repast Simphony Perspective is enabled
- Open the `NetworkSimulation` project in Eclipse.  (This can be done from the File -> Import -> General -> Import Existing Projects into Workspace menu option)
- In the PackageExplorer, open the `launchers` folder and select `NetworkSimulation Model.launch`.  Then, click the green Run button in Eclipse.  This will install the appropriate run configuration, and start the Repast GUI to run our models.
